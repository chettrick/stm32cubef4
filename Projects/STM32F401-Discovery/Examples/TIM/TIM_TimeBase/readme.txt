@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral in Output Compare Timing 
mode with the corresponding Interrupt requests for each channel in order to generate
4 different time bases.

The TIM3CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock / 2 (Hz), to get TIM3 counter 
clock at 60 KHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 84MHz for STM32F401xCx Devices.

The TIM3 CC1 register value is equal to 40961, 
CC1 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR1_Val = 1.4648 Hz,
so the TIM3 Channel 1 generates an interrupt each 0.68 s

The TIM3 CC2 register is equal to 27309, 
CC2 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR2_Val = 2.197 Hz
so the TIM3 Channel 2 generates an interrupt each 0.455 s

The TIM3 CC3 register is equal to 13654, 
CC3 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR3_Val = 4.394 Hz
so the TIM3 Channel 3 generates an interrupt each 0.227 s

The TIM3 CC4 register is equal to 6826, 
CC4 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR4_Val =  8.789 Hz
so the TIM3 Channel 4 generates an interrupt each 0.113 s

When the counter value reaches the Output compare registers values, the Output 
compare interrupts are generated and, in the handler routine, LED3(ORANGE, PD.13),
LED4(GREEN, PD.12), LED5(RED, PD.14) and  LED6(BLUE, PD.15) are toggled with the 
following frequencies: 

- PD.13: 1.464Hz (CC1)
- PD.12: 2.197Hz (CC2)
- PD.14: 4.394Hz (CC3) 
- PD.15: 8.789Hz (CC4)


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F401xCx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F401-Discovery RevB board (MB1115B)and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.    
      
  - STM32F401-Discovery RevB board (MB1115B) Set-up
    - Use LED3(ORANGE), LED4(GREEN), LED5(RED) and LED6(BLUE) connected respectively 
      to PD.13, PD.12, PD.14 and PD.15 pins and connect them on an oscilloscope to show 
      the different Time Base signals.  


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
