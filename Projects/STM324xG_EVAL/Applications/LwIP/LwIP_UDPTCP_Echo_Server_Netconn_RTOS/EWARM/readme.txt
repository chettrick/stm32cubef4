 @note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

                           structure that produces an executable image with IAR 
                           Embedded Workbench.
                
 - stm32f4xx_flash.icf : This file is the IAR Linker configuration file used to

 @par How to use it ?

 - Open the Project.eww workspace.
  - In the workspace toolbar select the project config:          
     - STM324x9I_EVAL: to configure the project for STM32F429x/439x devices.
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STM324x9I_EVAL, STM32F429X, USE_HAL_DRIVER
           
 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
 - Load project image: Project->Download and Debug
 - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)
